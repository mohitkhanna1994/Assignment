HEATMAP assignment: 
Using angularjs, create a heatmap dashboard with 2 panels/tabs. Rough design sketch attached as well (heatmap.jpg).

Functionality:
* Panel1: Shows ALL locations in a heatmap (side by side in a grid). 3 locations in json data(A/B/C). Each location has 7 metrics (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) and each metric has a integer value. Take a look at panel.json

* Panel2: Shows SPECIFIC location heatmap. It has a dropdown of all locations. On selecting a location, it shows sub-metrics(param1, param2, param3....). Each submetric is categorized into high medium low.

* One should be able to export to PDF or download as Image.

You CAN use:
  - angularjs framework and other JS libraries for heatmap assignment.
 
You should:
  - Pretend that this is as production-quality code for review. So, write modular & readable code.
  - Design for scalability (can show N number of locations - not just limited to 3 which is a test dataset)
  - Use any HTML5 feature supported by current Chrome
  - Make the UI as intuitive as you can.

You may:
  - Include Twitter Bootstrap or any other CSS frameworks for styling purposes 
  - Use Es6 or Typescript or Coffescript
  - Be as creative as possible with the UI/UX design but that's not the primary goal.
